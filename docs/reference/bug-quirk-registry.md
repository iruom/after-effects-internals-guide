# AEIG Bug / Quirk / Regression Registry

Curated entries: **32**. Fixed: **15**. Non-fixed / contract / historical entries: **17**.

This registry is an evidence index, not a claim that AEIG knows every After Effects bug. A symptom identifies a boundary to investigate; it does not by itself prove a private root cause.

| `BQ-0014` | `fixed` | `observability` | Help > Reveal Logging Files could crash more than 24 hours after logging was enabled | logging lifecycle/path/session rollover; Treat observability tooling as mutable runtime state with its own failure modes | Adobe fixed issues 25.3 |
| `BQ-0015` | `fixed` | `smartfx/bounds` | checkout_layer during SMART_PRE_RENDER could return empty rects | pre-render checkout/bounds contract; Historical workaround was retry; no longer needed from 11.0.1 | SmartFX Guide historical note |
| `BQ-0016` | `active-risk` | `cache/threading` | render can consume state different from the last QUERY_DYNAMIC_FLAGS response | dynamic capability generation/render identity; Snapshot dynamic state; return flags and render from the same generation | F-CACHE-010 |
| `BQ-0017` | `active-contract` | `state/threading` | state query returns randomized/unreliable state in unsafe UI context | UI/render synchronization/deadlock boundary; Do not derive render cache identity synchronously from UPDATE_PARAMS_UI | F-THREAD-002 |
| `BQ-0018` | `active-contract` | `image/convolution` | REPLICATE_BORDERS and ALPHA_WEIGHT_CONVOLVE are defined but ignored; only USE_LONG coefficient mode implemented | declared API surface versus implemented host semantics; Implement required border/alpha semantics yourself; test behavior rather than enum presence | F-KERNEL-001 |
| `BQ-0019` | `historical-pitfall` | `pica/suites` | deprecated suite handler acquisition/release behavior can leak suite references | PICA suite ownership/lifetime; Prefer AEFX_SuiteScoper or exact balanced acquisition/release | F-DESIGN-002 |
| `BQ-0020` | `sample-pitfall` | `cache/hash` | sample passes sizeof(const char*) where textual tag length may have been intended | cache-key construction/sample correctness; Hash explicit byte count/string contents; never copy sample code without C/C++ semantic review | Compute Cache sample |

| `BQ-0022` | `active-contract` | `gpu/image` | dereferencing PF_LayerDef.data during GPU Smart Render is invalid | CPU pointer versus GPU residency; Use GPU device/world access; data is null by contract | F-GPU-005 |

## Editorial rules

1. Fixed/known issue wording is behavioral evidence, not automatic proof of root cause.
2. Unsupported SDK/sample behavior is labeled as a contract warning or pitfall rather than public functionality.
3. Version scope is mandatory. Historical quirks are not silently described as current behavior.
4. Add a Finding when a bug materially supports an architectural conclusion; keep the registry row as the symptom/version index.
5. Preserve unknowns. If no workaround or cause is established, say so rather than inventing one.
