# Vector and Shape System

Shape layers combine a persistent vector object model, hierarchical transforms/modifiers and a renderer-facing tessellation/rasterization path.

## Questions
- What is the exact stream hierarchy for groups, paths, fills, strokes, repeaters and operators?
- Which operators change geometry versus only appearance/bounds?
- How are vector bounds cached and invalidated (`AE.VectorBoundsCache` is a local diagnostic clue, not semantic proof)?
- At what stage are shape paths tessellated, sampled and handed to CPU/GPU rendering?
- How does continuously rasterize/collapse behavior intersect with vector evaluation?
- How does direct Illustrator/SVG paste introduced in 26.3 map SVG concepts into native AE streams?

## Evidence surfaces
Scripting/AEGP streams; AEP differential corpus; local diagnostic keys; render-node traces; path suites; SVG/Illustrator paste experiments; one-pixel/bounds probes.

This domain should cross-link to animation, ROI/bounds, sampling, render graph, GPU and persistence rather than becoming an isolated feature chapter.

## AGM execution layer
AE 2024 Beta resources expose MultithreadedAGMShapeRendering, explicitly describing vector-shape rendering across multiple threads. Local installs retain AGM.dll from CS6 through 2025; AE 2025 also ships AdobeSVGAGM.dll and drawbotagm.dll. Media Encoder ships AGM-family modules as well, so AGM should be treated as an Adobe graphics substrate rather than an AE-only class name.

The current working model is: AE owns the editable Shape/Property/animation graph; an AGM-facing layer consumes evaluated vector geometry/appearance commands; the resulting vector rasterization/materialization rejoins AE's composition/render graph. The exact command boundary and whether tessellation or raster work is performed inside AGM remain open.

MultithreadedAGMShapeRendering is important because it separates vector-domain parallelism from frame-level MFR. Benchmarking should hold frame concurrency constant while varying single-frame shape complexity to isolate AGM's own threading.

## Adjacent 2024 internal features
The same Beta-feature corpus contains GroupAlphaForAIConvertToShapes, exposing a conversion-specific semantic issue: Illustrator group opacity needs preservation when converted into native shape fills. This is evidence that AI→Shape conversion is not merely path copying; group-level compositing semantics must be lowered into AE's shape/property model.

## Runtime model status
The runtime-side reconstruction is now tracked in `runtime-architecture.md`. AE 2025 exposes a concrete `BEE_VectorStream -> BEE_VectorArt -> AGM-facing translation -> RG_RenderNode` chain, with explicit vector bounds computation before rasterization. This upgrades the domain from surface mapping to a working internal model while leaving cache variants, operator-level reuse and the exact AGM/GPU execution boundary open.
